import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

import src from "../showcase/src/components/ui/bottom-sheet.tsx?raw";
import srcShowcase from "../showcase/src/app/showcase/bottom-sheet.tsx?raw";
import layoutSrc from "../showcase/src/app/_layout.tsx?raw";

<Code code={src} lang="tsx" />

## Usage

Add `BottomSheetModalProivder` to the root of your app.

<Aside type="caution">

Because React Native doesn't support portals, `@gorhom/bottom-sheet`
uses a custom portal implementation. It "physically" reloates the children
somewhere else (a direct child of `BottomSheetModalProivder`), so React
Context doesn't work unless the provider wraps the
`BottomSheetModalProivder`.

It is possible to get around this by either scoping the
`BottomSheetModalProivder` to a per-screen basis while wrapping it in context. You can also use
`BottomSheet`, mount it at the root of your screen, and pass the `ref` around,
but that can be annoying because you need one sheet per use.
